Abstract
========

This technote summarizes the groups and individuals making in-kind contributions to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory System Integration, Test, and Commissioning (SIT-Com) effort.

Introduction
============

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory recognizes the individuals listed below as making non-financial contributions to the System Integration, Test, and Commissioning (SIT-Com) effort to facilitate an efficient transition to LSST Operations and increase the overall scientific output of the survey.
By sharing their technical and scientific expertise, these individuals enhance and diversify the Project's planned commissioning effort.
The named participants will work directly alongside Rubin Observatory staff in completing their assignments and, in exchange, will have access to commissioning data products as they are acquired.
The Project will not rely on the contributions from non-Rubin-staff team members to fulfill core construction requirements and operational readiness criteria.

The participating individuals were invited to join the Rubin Observatory SIT-Com effort through one of two programs:

1. US/Chile Commissioning Announcement of Opportunity Program, and
2. International In-Kind Contribution Program where the recipient group is the “Rubin Commissioning Team”.

Both types of contributions are being managed by Rubin Observatory as a combined resource.
As indicated below, the in-kind contributions are organized into discrete groups of like interests and skills.
Each contributing group has identified a point of contact to the Rubin Observatory Project; this group leader is responsible for management of the group and for the timely completion of assigned tasks.
We anticipate that participants will engage in multiple aspects of commissioning according to their abilities, participation level, the Project schedule, and the designated priorities of Rubin Observatory.

The deep level of engagement described in these programs comes with specific rights and responsibilities, as outlined in Section 4.1 of the `Announcement of Opportunity <https://sitcomtn-010.lsst.io/>`__.
Working as part of the SIT-Com team offers direct experience with the full chain from observations to final data products and data access tools that will be released to the science community, including the hardware, image properties, and Science Pipeline algorithms.
Through their efforts, these individuals will enhance the readiness of Rubin Observatory and ultimately improve the science products that will be delivered to the global Rubin community.

No papers presenting novel scientific results based on commissioning data may be posted/submitted by anyone before the associated Data Preview release date (see `Rubin Data Policy <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/RDO-013>`__).
The focus of the commissioning effort is on demonstrating operational readiness rather than realizing scientific discoveries with the commissioning data itself.

All members of the SIT-Com team are expected to follow the `professional standards of conduct <https://www.lsst.org/scientists/codes-of-conduct>`__ adopted by the Project.

Section 3.3 of this document lists several additional institutional contributions to Rubin Observatory construction based on agreements that were established prior to the formalization of the two programs mentioned above.
These university-based groups are making contributions that are partially supported by external sources and are listed in this document together with other in-kind contributions for completeness.

Section 3.4 of this document lists additional voluntary contributions from international groups separate from the International In-Kind Contribution Program.

Section 3.4 of this document lists the ex officio members of the Commissioning Team, as described in Section 3.2 of the `Announcement of Opportunity <https://sitcomtn-010.lsst.io/>`__.
